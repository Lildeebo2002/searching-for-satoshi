# searching-for-satoshi

i was looking, and i think i found you. thank you and i'll see you soon. Cheers!

## Here was my initial hyphothesis and outlook.

It's highly likely that Satoshi either **DIED**, lost the keys to his kingdom through some **ACCIDENT**, or is actually a **GOVERNMENT** entity. Those are the 3 main endgame scenarios to the debate IMO. It's very unlikely that Satoshi is still alive, with all his fortunes, and just values his/her privacy too much to let anyone know.

## After searching:

1. **Satoshi is living and maintaining his silence** -- I was very skeptical at the start of this search, but now I may have to eat my hat. I believe I know who Satoshi is. I consider Satoshi a friend and I will not betray him. I will end my public search logs with that promise, to respect his privacy.

2. **Satoshi is dead** -- If Satoshi is dead, He was Hal Finney. Hal may have played a little joke on all of us and made up his "friend" Satoshi. His loss is one of the saddest in the history of computer science, and in fact all of history.

3. **Satoshi is a government** -- If Satoshi was/is a government, it is probably either the NSA or KGB in my opinion. Either option opens up a series of questions that could fill a hundred spy novels.

4. **Satoshi lost his keys** -- I don't believe this for a second. This category includes Craig Wright, who couldn't even produce a valid crypto signature in his "confession", so he obviously doesn't understand even the basics. The minimum I would trust is a full GPG signature of a testimonial document, signed by Satoshi's PGP key, which [is known](). A close second would be an improvised signature from the private key of Satoshi's mining addresses. The real Satoshi would have no problem producing such a signature.
