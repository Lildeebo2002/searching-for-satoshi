# searching-for-satoshi

i'm looking. where are you? if you're alive, thank you and i'll see you soon.

## Before I get too deep, here are my current ideas.

It's highly likely that Satoshi either **DIED**, lost the keys to his kingdom through some **ACCIDENT**, or is actually a **GOVERNMENT** entity. Those are the 3 main endgame scenarios to the debate IMO. It's very unlikely that Satoshi is still alive, with all his fortunes, and just values his/her privacy too much to let anyone know.

## My theories for each scenario in order of sureness:

1. **Satoshi is dead** -- He was Hal Finney. I think Hal played a little joke on all of us and made up his "friend" Satoshi. His loss is one of the saddest in the history of computer science, and in fact all of history.

2. **Satoshi lost his keys** -- I don't believe this for a second. This category includes Craig Wright, who couldn't even produce a valid crypto signature in his "confession", so he obviously doesn't understand even the basics. The minimum I would trust is a full GPG signature used by Satoshi's PGP key, which is known. A close second would be an improvised signature from the private key of Satoshi's mining addresses. The real Satoshi would have no problem producing such a signature.

3. **Satoshi is a government** -- Probably either the NSA or KGB in my opinion. Either option opens up a series of questions that could fill a hundred spy novels.

4. **Satoshi is living and maintaining his silence** -- I don't believe this. At this point, it's like believing in God. There's no proof and there probably won't be any, forever. And I don't believe in God, because I'm a scientist. If Satoshi pulled this off, he/she/it is probably the greatest hacker to ever live. Respect.
