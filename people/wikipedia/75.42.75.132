Added 2 revisions to wiki articles for RSA, and earliest description of Bitcoin POW:

Added "Prime Number Hide-And-Seek:" prefix to this link:

quote:

  Notice what we have here. We take a number, T, and raise it to a power, and when we do the calculation in modulus arithmetic, we wind up with T again. In short, we have a recipe for a function that returns its own input (presuming that R has been chosen ahead of time, and that T is verified to be relatively prime to R).

'''Bitcoin''' is an open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system developed by Satoshi Nakamoto that's completely [[P2P|decentralized]], with no central server or trusted parties. Users hold the [[cryptography|crypto]] keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of the network to check for double-spending.

==Proof-of-work==
 	+	
 	+	
To preserve the integrity of BitCoin, users must not be allowed to double-spend their tokens.  To prevent this, all transactions are broadcasted over the network.
 	+	
 	+	
To keep this information reliable, it is protected against errors caused by failures of communication or deliberate sabotage.  To resolve possible conflicts in the record, it is necessary to determine what data was produced first, and what data was produced later.
 	+	
 	+	
BitCoin solves this problem (without a trusted timestamp authority) by using a [[proof-of-work]] mechanism, similar to that used by [[HashCash]].  When data is received through a node, the node performs a proof-of-work and adds it to the data.  Other nodes receive the data, perform a proof-of-work, and add it to the data, ad infinitum.  The longest proof-of-work chain is acknowledged to be the oldest and most reliable account of the online transactions.
 	+	
 	+	
This mechanism is thought to be virtually tamper-proof.  For an attacker to manipulate the record, he must outpace all of the other nodes on the network to produce the longest proof-of-work.  This becomes exponentially more difficult, the longer the chain becomes. 
 	+	
 	+	
BitCoin is a completely peer-to-peer network, and every node is able to enter or leave the network at will.  When a node joins the network, the longest proof-of-work is automatically accepted as the most reliable one.
