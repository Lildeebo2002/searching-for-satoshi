Bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system developed by Satoshi Nakamoto that's completely [[P2P|decentralized\\, with no central server or trusted parties. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of the network to check for double-spending.
